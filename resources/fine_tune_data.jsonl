A main symptom in a third of POTS patients is fainting.\u00a0\n\n>The researchers were from\u00a0Monash University\u00a0and led by Professor Sam El-Osta who said that while the gene implicated in POTS \u00a0norepinephrine\u00a0transporter (NET)  had been known for several decades, past research had failed to find a genetic mutation responsible for the symptoms. This latest study revealed that the enzyme EZH2 is responsible for silencing this gene.\n\n"}
