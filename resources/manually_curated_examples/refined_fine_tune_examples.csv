"s6aw61", "Populations: anxiety, lupus. Interventions: prednisone. Outcomes: flare up. Using this information, write a short personal medical claim written by a reddit or twitter user.","Anxiety from prednisone taper or flare? Has anyone experienced this from tapering prednisone? (I know going on prednisone can cause it but I wonder about coming off it). Or could it be from the increased flares and flare symptoms from lowering the dose?  As I know flares can cause anxiety too."
"r63iuv", "Populations: Sinus issues, Inflammation. Interventions: Pineapple Juice. Using this information, write a short personal medical claim written by a reddit or twitter user.","Anyone with sinus issues drinking pineapple juice? It's a weird question, but I saw a post about pineapple juice being good for sinus issues (helps with the inflammation) and just wondered if anyone has done this?  Some people were commenting about the high sugar content in pineapple juice not being good, but they get around that by taking a supplement instead of drinking the juice."
"rep83s","Populations: h pylori. Interventions: pepcid, gaviscon. Using this information, write a short personal medical claim written by a reddit or twitter user.","So it seems the most accurate ways to test for h pylori include biopsies and breath test. My H Pylori biopsies have always come back negative, but I'm now finding out that PPI's can cause false-negatives, and I've always been on daily PPI's. I've been able to get off them recently (barely) but in order to do so, I've been popping pepcid and swigging gavsicon advance like it's candy."
"s9sfft","Populations: lupus. Interventions: cellcept, Prednisone, Cytoxan Outcomes: lupus nephritis, inflammation. Using this information, write a short personal medical claim written by a reddit or twitter user.","Cytoxan and prednisone Rheumatologist says cellcept failed to protect my kidneys and now I have developed lupus nephritis.Im so upset. Prednisone messed up my hips so badly that they both need to be replacedI dont want to get back on it but rheumatologist says its to bring the inflammation down in my kidneys. Ive never been on Cytoxan but the side effects sound identical to a lupus flare. How am I supposed to be positive with news like this? I feel so defeatedI dont know what to do."
