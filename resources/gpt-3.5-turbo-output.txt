    Foot and shoe fitting problems
Am I the only one who has a problem with finding shoes fitting correctly? My feet always feel so tender and so many shoes irritate them or just don't fit correctly. The only style I seem to have any luck with is a mary jane with a strap and a 5 cm heel.

Flats fall off and hurts my arches. Runners rub against my feet weird. Heels are impossible
    Medical abstract:
    Coronary artery calcification (CAC) develops early in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and is a strong and independent predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Arterial calcification is caused by an imbalance in calcification regulatory mechanisms. An important inhibitor of calcification is vitamin K-dependent matrix Gla protein (MGP). Both preclinical and clinical studies have shown that inhibition of the vitamin K-cycle by vitamin K antagonists (VKA) results in elevated uncarboxylated MGP (ucMGP) and subsequently in extensive arterial calcification. This led us to hypothesize that vitamin K supplementation may slow down the progression of calcification. To test this, we designed the VitaK-CAC trial which analyses effects of menaquinone-7 (MK-7) supplementation on progression of CAC. The trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial including patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients with a baseline Agatston CAC-score between 50 and 400 will be randomized to an intervention-group (360 microgram MK-7) or a placebo group. Treatment duration will be 24 months. The primary endpoint is the difference in CAC-score progression between both groups. Secondary endpoints include changes in arterial structure and function, and associations with biomarkers. We hypothesize that treatment with MK-7 will slow down or arrest the progression of CAC and that this trial may lead to a treatment option for vascular calcification and subsequent CVD.

    Psychosis (as its described now) doesnt really exist
If you think about it, everyone lives in a sort-of psychosis, because most things in society are imaginative constructs. A professor in a twead coat, with a cane and a monocle, playing with the role and the demeanor of being the most-learned person while his students as servile subjects gaze up at him, supposing him an academic lord he is psychotic.

A prime minister playing king, a therapist posturing as a mans great counselor. These altered states of mind and social roles are nothing more than imaginations, not so severe as a mentally-ill person on a sleepless, 3-day bender with mania but nevertheless.

Also, if you feel youre being watched, you may be: post-9/11, there are cameras everywhere

    BACKGROUND


A cluster randomised trial of mHealth and participatory learning and action (PLA) community mobilisation interventions showed that PLA significantly reduced the prevalence of intermediate hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the incidence of T2DM among adults in rural Bangladesh; mHealth improved knowledge but showed no effect on glycaemic outcomes. We explore the equity of intervention reach and impact.
METHODS


Intervention reach and primary outcomes of intermediate hyperglycaemia and T2DM were assessed through interview surveys and blood fasting glucose and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance tests among population-based samples of adults aged â‰¥30 years. Age-stratified, gender-stratified and wealth-stratified intervention effects were estimated using random effects logistic regression.
RESULTS


PLA participants were similar to non-participants, though female participants were younger and more likely to be married than female non-participants. Differences including age, education, wealth and marital status were observed between individuals exposed and those not exposed to the mHealth intervention.PLA reduced the prevalence of T2DM and intermediate hyperglycaemia in all age, gender and wealth strata. Reductions in 2-year incidence of T2DM of at least 51% (0.49, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.92) were observed in all strata except among the oldest and least poor groups. mHealth impact on glycaemic outcomes was observed only among the youngest group, where a 47% reduction in the 2-year incidence of T2DM was observed (0.53, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.00).
CONCLUSION


Large impacts of PLA across all strata indicate a highly effective and equitable intervention. mHealth may be more suitable for targeting higher risk, younger populations.

    Objective


Psychological consequences of myocardial infarction (MI) are substantial, as 4% of all MI patients develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 12% clinically relevant posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The study investigated the course and development within 12 months of MI-induced PTSS to gain novel insights in potentially delayed response to early trauma-focused counseling aimed at preventing the incidence of MI-induced PTSS.
Methods


In the MI-SPRINT two-group randomized controlled trial, 190 MI-patients were randomly allocated to receive a single-session intervention of either trauma-focused counseling or an active control intervention targeting the general role of stress in patients with heart disease. Blind interviewer-rated PTSS (primary outcome) and additional health outcomes were assessed at 12-month follow-up.
Results


12-month follow-up of outcomes were available for 106 (55.8%) of 190 participants: In the entire sample, one patient (0Â·5%, 1/190) who received trauma-focused counseling developed full PTSD. There was no significant difference between trauma-focused counseling and stress counseling regarding total score of interviewer-rated PTSS ( p  > 0.05). The only group difference emerged in terms of more severe hyperarousal symptoms in the trauma-focused counseling group in the ITT analysis, but not in the completer analysis.
Conclusions


No benefits were found for trauma-focused counseling after 12 months when compared with an active control intervention. PTSD prevalence in the present study was low highlighting a potential beneficial effect of both interventions. Further studies are needed to determine the most accurate approach of counseling.

    INTRODUCTION


A journal club (JC) is a commonly used medical educational tool. Videoconferencing technology can facilitate the delivery of JCs, however, there remains no evidence on the role of web-based virtual JCs in promoting the acquisition and retention of medical knowledge. The Web-Ed trial aims to evaluate the educational benefits, feasibility and acceptability of web-based virtual JCs compared with traditional face-to-face ones.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS


Web-Ed is a multicentre pragmatic parallel-group randomised trial across teaching hospitals within the UK National Health Service (NHS). We will enrol qualified doctors or medical students who are >18 years old, proficient in English and able to use online videoconferencing software. Block randomisation will be used to allocate participants in 1:1 ratio to either intervention group. Both groups will be presented with the same educational material and follow a standardised JC structure hosted by nominated moderators and medical faculty members.The primary outcome is the difference in participants' knowledge acquisition and retention 7â€‰days after the JCs evaluated using standardised multiple-choice questions. We will report secondarily on the feasibility and acceptability of the JCs using Likert scale questionnaires. Assuming a 30% drop-out rate, we aim to enrol 75 participants to detect a 20% improvement in knowledge acquisition at 80% power and 5% significance. We will report using mean difference or risk ratio with 95% CIs and assess significance using parametric/non-parametric testing. Where relevant, we will adjust for predetermined characteristics (age, grade of training and session duration) using multivariate regression analyses.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION


Web-Ed was designed by doctors in training to address their learning needs and evaluate the preferred mode of learning. The trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant scientific conferences. The trial has been approved by the NHS Health Regulation Authority (21/HRA/3361).
