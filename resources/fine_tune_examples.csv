Ive never really had anxiety before (over thinking a situation maybe) but nothing like Ive experienced the last few weeks of too nervous to think or relax, a hot face feeling and like my stomach is dropping like Im on a roller coaster.
Has anyone experienced this from tapering prednisone? (I know going on prednisone can cause it but I wonder about coming off it). Or could it be from the increased flares and flare symptoms from lowering the dose?  As I know flares can cause anxiety too.
Ive had lupus for 5 years, been on prednisone for most of it. But only in the last couple months have I been able to taper prednisone a bit. So this phase is new to me.
Thanks for any help."

It's a weird question, but I saw a post about pineapple juice being good for sinus issues (helps with the inflammation) and just wondered if anyone has done this?  Some people were commenting about the high sugar content in pineapple juice not being good, but they get around that by taking a supplement instead of drinking the juice.  Anyone?"
